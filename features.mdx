## Reusable Components

Reusable components ensure your documentation maintains a professional, uniform look. You integrate elements like `<Tabs>`, `<Steps>`, and `<CodeGroup>` directly into MDX files. This approach saves time and enforces branding consistency.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Start with the component library to preview live examples and copy-paste code.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to incorporate components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MDX Support" icon="download">
    Add MDX processing to your build tool.

````bash
npm install @mdx-js/loader
````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Components" icon="code">
    Import from the Documentation.AI package.

````javascript
import { Callout, Steps } from '@documentation-ai/components';
````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in Pages" icon="edit-3">
    Embed in your `.mdx` files for instant rendering.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI Assistant

The AI assistant accelerates content creation by generating full sections or refining existing text. You interact via the dashboard editor or CLI for suggestions on structure, clarity, and completeness.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard" icon="monitor">
    Open your project in the dashboard at `https://dashboard.documentation.ai`.

    1. Highlight text and select "Generate Suggestions".
    2. Choose "Expand Section" or "Simplify Language".
    3. Review and apply AI outputs seamlessly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI" icon="terminal">
    Use the command-line tool for batch processing.

````bash
docs-ai generate --file features.mdx --mode suggestions
docs-ai write --prompt "Explain reusable components" --output new-section.mdx
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
// Example: AI-generated component usage
import { Callout } from '@documentation-ai/components';

<Callout kind="info">
  AI suggested this callout for key tips.
</Callout>;
```
```python
# Python integration example
from documentation_ai import AIAssistant

assistant = AIAssistant(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
content = assistant.generate("Document Steps component")
print(content)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Publishing and Maintaining

Publish your documentation with one-click deploys to a custom domain. The platform handles versioning, previews, and automatic updates, keeping your docs always current.

<Expandable title="Advanced Maintenance Workflow" default-open="false">

Maintain dynamic docs by enabling webhooks for Git integration.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Edit MDX] --> B[Commit to Git]
    B --> C[Webhook Trigger]
    C --> D[Build & Preview]
    D --> E[Publish Live]
```

Set webhook URL: `https://hooks.documentation.ai/your-project/webhook`.

## Transforming Static Manuals

Convert legacy PDFs or static Markdown into interactive hubs. Upload files, let AI parse and enhance with components, then publish as a searchable site.

1. Upload your manual to the dashboard.
2. AI auto-generates structure with headings and components.
3. Customize with `<Tabs>` for multi-version support.
4. Deploy as an interactive hub with search and navigation.

This process turns passive documents into active resources where users get instant answers through AI-powered search.
